This is a simple terminal-based simulation of resource allocation game.

The game runs for four iterations of the game in a 10*10 grid.

User inputs are simulated with 10% of cells tested, and 5% containment in every step.

Tested cells are visualzed with * like \*red\*, and disconnected cells are
visualized with [] like [red].

Steps to run the game on the console/terminal:
1) Install node
2) Open terminal or npm console in windows
3) Navigate to the folder
4) > node graphs.js
